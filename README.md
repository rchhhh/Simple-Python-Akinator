# Simple-Python-Akinator
A simple akinator script written in python, no library are necessaries, the list script is used to create the list juste by the akinator script

to add peoples you need to edit the ma list in the script as follows : ma = [[attribute1, [firstguy, second guy]], [attribute2, [first guy, second guy]]] etc ...
you can use the list script to edit it more easely, just put your actual "ma" list in it replacing the "ma" and "mb" lists in it, once you finish using the program it will output the new "ma" list intended with new peoples or attributes.
Also there is a french version you can see at https://pornhyb.fr/acanator.html ( there also is streamed football game there, don't pay attention to the hostname it was intended for something else )
